      "\"Damn and blast!\" Rincewind said, peering up from the cold, hard dirt -- at least, he would think of it as dirt -- as the Creatures of the Dungeon Dimensions variously lurched and wobbled closer towards him. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now not only was he going to face an endless nightmare of unending suffering without hope for the sweet mercies of death, but he was going to do so naked, which was to say, without his hat. A wizard, or in his case a Wizzard, could only truly be said to be in the nudd if he had lost his hat of office, and since the Luggage had kept a firm grip on his hat in a vain attempt to pull him back through the recently opened portal to the Dungeon Dimensions, he was now not only here but also thoroughly embarrassed, not at his disrobed state but at the lack of that one badge of office which would have allowed him at least a modicum of dignity as he gibbered with fear and agony for all time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Picking up his staff, Rincewind judged he had about 100 revolutions of a demon's hand before the Creatures reached him. He could hold his breath longer than that, if only because unlike most wizards he preferred being able to run long distances at great speed to the pleasures of a pipe. It wasn't much time, but should grant him just enough life to make a new hat. It was important, the hat. Death himself came for wizards, at the end. But bare-arsed Rincewind with no hat proclaiming his Wizzardry might not warrant the honor. So he needed a hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rincewind had barely received a pass on completing his hat. It had flopped slightly at the top, and he'd been marked down for sp., whatever that was, but he'd done it. It had been judged not worth the trouble of trying to teach him again how to do it properly, so he had been allowed to get on with wearing it on strict orders that he not do anything to embarrass the University, which he had promptly broken at 11:42A-M (Ankh-Morporkian) by turning several mugs of beer into a large pile of sick.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, he'd made a hat once, and he would do it again before he died if he had anything to say about. Which he did. Once he remembered the words to the spell.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the problem with Rincewind. He had done perfectly well with remembering spells right up until that time he'd answered a dare to read the Octavo, the Creator's own grimoire. Since then, he'd never been able to remember the words to any spells, including the one which had leapt off the page and into his mind. But now, with a certain incessant, imperative need oozing and shuffling towards him, the words began to form. He could remember. And yes, it had never been the best of hats, but it was HIS hat, and marked him a Wizzard, and he would not go to his eternal unrest without it. He didn't even mind the floppy bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ashonai.\" he began. \"Ebiris. Urshoring. Kvanti.\" That, he thought, would make the brim, and the pointy bit. \"Pythan.\" The stars. \"N'gurad.\" The moon. \"Feringomalee.\" Not all graduates of Unseen University felt the need to write \"Wizzard\" out on their hats, but he liked to make things plain and simple for any tavern tough who might think twice about assaulting a wizard and then, following the thought process through a second time, would emerge to find that said \"Wizzard\" was three city blocks away and rapidly increasing the distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Isgendie.\" He finished, and stood waiting, but nothing happened. Last time, his hat had popped neatly, or, rather, had popped disheveledly into existence, but it had most definitely popped. And quickly. Almost as soon as he had spoken the last words, as a matter of fact. Why, no sooner had he said \"Mitra Capuchone Aureole Regentia Magus Chapeau...\" \n",
      "\n",
      "But wait. Those weren't the words of the spell he'd just uttered. Although now, he couldn't remember the words he had spoken, but he knew they'd been...different. What had it meant, though?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah. Now he had an answer. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!\" he screamed as a light whose brilliance he had never before dreamt of engulfed him, cascading in unending glory and searing brightness through the whole world, or what passed for one here in the Dungeon Dimensions. As though it meant to consume all, the light filled every space, every thing, until it felt soon there would be nothing but the light. \n",
      "\n",
      "Kneeling in awe and too overwhelmed to think, Rincewind was at first oblivious to, then puzzled by, a tapping on his shoulder. He looked up to see the one Being who, even in the light of all the stars that ever were, could still radiate a deep black.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"HELLO AGAIN, RINCEWIND,\" the robed figure said, peering at him with the eyeless gaze of eternity. \"I SHOULD BE GETTING ALONG NOW, IF I WERE YOU.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Rincewind looked at Death, something he liked to avoid whenever possible but now found almost a relief in the wash, no, the torrent of light that caused his eyes to water even when they were shut tight. \"Aren't you here for me?\" he yelled, unsure why the blinding radiance made him feel compelled to shout to be heard, as though the light were noise. \"I tried to make the hat! I tried! You have to take me! I'm a Wizzard! Don't leave me to those things!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Death turned back to him, scythe blade rasping along a whetstone, and the rictus of his skeletal jaw seemed even more than usual to have the slightest hint of a grin to it. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"OH, I'M NOT HERE FOR YOU. NOT TODAY. NO, YOU HAVE MILES TO GO BEFORE YOU SLEEP.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do?\" Rincewind roared. \"But how? How do I return to the Discworld? I don't even know how I came to be here!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"STEP INTO THE LIGHT.\" Death intoned.\n",
      "\n",
      "It held enough command that Rincewind asked no more. He stepped towards the source, the bright heart of a thousand suns, and found himself falling, plummeting down a tunnel made of pure Octarine light, a beam of magical energy radiating into the Dungeon Dimensions from some unknown source. Unknown, until he fell with a sudden and spectacularly uncomfortable CRACK on the lid of the Luggage, which had been sitting mournfully by the wall he'd been pulled through, battered hat still firmly gripped in its...mouth, he supposed. He watched, as from every direction the magical field of the Discworld coalesced into a living, pulsing light that flowed in a stream towards the Dungeon Dimensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose we ought to run,\" he told the Luggage, \"though with that much magic to feed on I don't know that anywhere will be safe from those Creatures.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Luggage made a kind of small hopping gesture towards the portal through which Rincewind had twice fallen, the one from which he'd landed in cold, gritty dirt on some other world, naked, as he realized he still was, quickly grabbing his hat. And then he saw. Saw that the magic of the Discworld was not feeding the Creatures. It was coalescing. It was a single glint, brighter than a diamond made of fire, on the point of a scythe. It was honed to such a fine edge that where it swooshed through the air the sound of cutting glass could be heard. \n",
      "\n",
      "Death looked up at the Creatures from the Dungeon Dimensions, and, just possibly, grinned a little bit more. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"I CAME HERE\" HE DECLAIMED, \"TO CHEW AN EMULSION OF SUGAR AND RUBBER EXTRACTED FROM TREES, AND KICK ASS. AND THE CHEWING HAS FAILED OWING TO MY LACK OF CHEEKS AND THE EMULSION SUBSEQUENTLY FALLING INTO THIS DIRT HERE.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A smaller robed figure emitted what would have been appraised by anyone listening nearby to be an approving squeak.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Creatures never had time to flee. \n",
      "\n",
      "The End\n",
      "\n",

There are a handful of countries with clear (and well-studied) cultural (and other) factors contributing to abnormally high rates of suicide. Some of them don't have many guns. But, thanks to actual research, we know that, despite a bunch of gun nuts claiming that these outliers vindicate their absurd arguments, suicides can be lowered by reducing the availability of firearms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, so what you are saying that culture plays a significant role in whether people harm themselves or others.  Congratulations, you are now a pro-gun extremist, because you admitted that the gun isn't the major cause, but rather a symptom.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt; Hell, in this fucking comment thread I had someone respond to tell me they're living evidence that the absence of a gun prevents some suicides.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, an anecdote.  The plural of anecdote is not data.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt; You just used the term \"the primary factor\". Do you believe that term has meaning, in that context, in the field of research? I ask, because that's the sort of term someone with no background in research methodology would use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yawn.  Here's a list of some risk factors for suicide:\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt; * Mental disorders, particularly mood disorders, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders and certain personality disorders\n",
      "* Alcohol and other substance use disorders\n",
      "* Hopelessness\n",
      "* Impulsive and/or aggressive tendencies\n",
      "* History of trauma or abuse\n",
      "* Major physical illnesses\n",
      "* Previous suicide attempt\n",
      "* Family history of suicide\n",
      "* Job or financial loss\n",
      "* Loss of relationship\n",
      "* Easy access to lethal means\n",
      "* Local clusters of suicide\n",
      "* Lack of social support and sense of isolation\n",
      "* Stigma associated with asking for help\n",
      "* Lack of health care, especially mental health and substance abuse treatment\n",
      "* Cultural and religious beliefs, such as the belief that suicide is a noble resolution of a personal dilemma\n",
      "* Exposure to others who have died by suicide (in real life or via the media and Internet)\n",
      "\n",
      "Of them, access to lethal means is merely one.  Here's the thing: even the lowest estimates of firearms ownership in the US has 1/3rd of households having them, or 100 million.  Meanwhile, there's 20k suicides yearly.  There's tons of ways to self harm besides guns, including draino, sharp objects and rope (none of which have any background checks).  Despite this, you don't see people killing themselves in firearms ownership utopia US in greater rates than gun free areas like Japan, etc.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Ergo, guns don't cause people to kill themselves.  Guns are a symptom, not the cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt; I don't use conclusion-driven research. I use peer-reviewed, forefront-of-the-field research with the research community's consensus backing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "LOL no, you use agenda driven, cherry picked research with dubious methodology, hence your citation of:\n",

      "&gt; http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/gun-ownership-and-use/\n",
      "\n",

      "&gt; You just used the term \"the primary factor\". Do you believe that term has meaning, in that context, in the field of research? I ask, because that's the sort of term someone with no background in research methodology would use.\n",
      "Factors are factors. Some countries have a number of strong factors contributing to suicide. Others have fewer. Gun availability, where present, is a consistent risk factor, as the research demonstrates.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the purposes of \"should we restrict firearms in order to prevent suicides\" you better well believe that it has meaning, yes.  If you cannot conclusively show that firearms reduction will not be offset by other costs and substitution of method, you lose.  \n",
      "\n",
      "&gt; I'm absolutely certain that gun availability isn't the strongest contributing factor to suicides, worldwide. No one is claiming that. And it doesn't matter. If it's a contributing factor (and we know it is), we should probably consider addressing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody except the people trying to imply that gun control would help suicide.  \n",
      "\n",
      "&gt; Yeah, thought so. I keep hoping that one day I'll come across the unicorn gun rights supporter who doesn't manage to demonstrate utter intellectual bankruptcy within ten posts. Not today, sadly. I'm sure you're terribly sorry to disappoint.\n",

      "Yawn.  Pot, meet kettle.  When you can link to honest studies that don't display a litany of logical fallacies or agenda based, conclusion driven research your whining will have merit. Until then, you proved my point: [you aren't interested in actually saving lives, you burned up that suspension of disbelief long ago when the solution to every problem was ban guns](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3inupe/more_americans_killed_by_guns_since_1968_than_in/cuidyii) \n",
      "What's your background? I double majored in sociology and cultural anthropology. And just about the biggest thing we learn is that if a societal phenomenon seems extremely complicated the reality is its probably twice as complicated as it seems. \n",
      "\n",
      "So boil that shit down, the US features high rates of gun ownership and relatively high rates of violent crime among developed nations (though it still doesn't even break the top 100 countries with the highest homicide rates). \n",
      "\n",
      "Norway has very very low gun ownership comparatively and also has very very low crime rates. Well that seems obvious right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well hold on Switzerland has among the highest gun ownership rates in the world and actually has less restrictive gun laws than my home state. Yet still far lower crime rates. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Czech Republic also has exceedingly liberal gun laws and high gun ownership yet still has lower homicide than the US\n",

      "\n",
      "The Swiss and Norwegians both have extremely high rates of societal participation and very low rates of poverty and very very lenient punishments for crimes (focused more on rehabilitation). \n",
      "\n",
      "The US and Czech Republic are actually very comparable as they have near identical poverty rates. So why the difference in gun crime? Well notably in the Czech Republic *all* recreational drugs are decriminalized rendering the drug trade mostly impotent. Over 90% of gun crime in the US occurs within organized crime disputes and so-called gang violence. As you can see shit is complicated \n",
      "\n",
      "Now like I said the US homicide rate is only high *comparatively*. The countries that actually have high murder rates such as Mexico and much of Latin America have *extremely* restrictive gun laws. Now here's the interesting thing, bring this up and the average anti-gun individual will immediately point out that those countries are far more poor, uneducated and unemployed\n",
      "\n",
      "Well hold on now they just conceded that poverty and alienation supercede availability of guns in the cause of violent crime. And here's the thing, compare the *demographics* of who are the victims and perpetrators of violent crime in the US and you'll find their levels of low education, high poverty and unemployment, societal alienation suddenly become very comparable to those Latin American nations. Especially when you consider prevalence of the drug trade. \n",
      "\n",
      "So what causes gun related crime? Well a whole lot of shit. But if you want to know the single biggest factor in the US I'll tell you.\n",
      "\n",
      "The GI Bill and housing associations. Wut? Consider this, after the so-called great migration in which black Americans fled the south en mass major industrial cities like Detroit, LA, Chicago and so on boomed. WW2 allowed many black families well paying jobs in these industrial regions as labor was in such demand. \n",
      "\n",
      "A black middle class very comparable to the white equivalent began to form. However black Americans quickly experienced a practice called red lining. Home owners associations and neighborhood covenants forbid houses in those neighborhoods from being sold to black families. This was one of the lesser known forms of de facto (rather than de jure) segregation. Then WW2 ended and the soldiers came home \n",
      "\n",
      "Despite what any \"free market conservative\" will tell you the massive economic boom of the 1950s was caused almost entirely by government spending. Namely in the form of a feature of the GI Bill which offered subsidized housing loans to veterans. Buttloads of houses were bought and built and people were able to develop equity due to the resulting rise in property values.\n",
      "\n",
      "But those subsidized loans were explicitly not available to black veterans. Instead they got subsidized public housing. They didn't get to own property they had to rent and thus couldn't develop that sort of equity that leads to generational wealth.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is where modern ghettos came from. The 60s happen, oh hey all of these cool black leaders are murdered and jailed and you have a generation growing up in the 70s with the same anger and oppression but no direction. Did you know the Crips were originally formed in an effort to recreate what the Black Panthers were? Suddenly manufacturing jobs are disappearing. This is no problem for the white kids because their parents had been able to sell houses for way more than they bought them for and send them to college \n",
      "\n",
      "Not so for the black kids. They're dealing with unemployment and begin turning to the drug trade for survival primarily in the form of heroin. Then crack happens. Suddenly the Reaganites decide they need to stop this epidemic so crack will send you to jail for 5 times longer than cocaine (a drug mostly used by white yuppies).\n",
      "\n",
      "So by the 90s you've got an entire generation with at least 1 parent behind bars. A generation that like those before it is oppressed and angry and stuck in a cycle of poverty. They have kids young due to a lack of education and you get a new generation raised by children, oppressed abused and angry with no way out but the drug trade and sports\n",

      "\n",
      "And here's the hard truth the anti-gun crowd needs to accept. There are over 300 million **legal** guns in circulation and an unknown amount on the black market. It is, and I emphasize, **impossible** to control that. If we ban guns flat out tomorrow it'll be a century before we see real results for that reason. \n",
      "\n",
      "You want to lower gun crime? Ok you need serious radical economic reforms. You need to decouple school funding from property taxes, you need **free** child care within poor black communities and well funded schools pre k-12, you need free college tuition offered to all those who graduate, you need jobs programs and you need the immediate decriminalization of recreational drugs\n",
      "\n",
      "**That** will reduce gun crime to almost nothing in a decade. \n",

When I first cottoned on to what was happening I decided to time everything so as to form some sort of escape and evade my seemingly inevitable death. For days I watched the clock religiously and timed everything that happened but eventually had to concede that although there were no drastic differences, there was definitely some discrepancy between the times that each event would take place. It was mostly a few minutes here and there but on some days it could even stretch up to an hour! I knew my death was coming each day but not knowing when kept me on edge and made this odd hell feel even more torturous. \n",

      "The first time I thought that the voices meant that I was safe, I had hope - zombies didn’t speak in normal voices, it had to mean I was with the uninfected. But then, then I would hear the voices getting louder. And then the screaming would start. \n",
      "Once you’ve heard a real zombie scream… that noise gets etched on to your brain you know? It’s a furious kind of animal-like gargle and scream mushed into one.\n",
      "Next the screaming dies away and then, the rattling always begins again. \n",
      "That rattling, no matter how many times I’ve heard it, it makes me panic. \n",

      "The Confederate flag and our Southern heritage has been mistreated and criticized against as being racist. How can you say that our flag is racist? Because we owned slaves during the Civil War? That would be a horrible misunderstanding because Southerners were NOT the only states who had slaves. Union commander and general Ulysses S. Grant owned a personal slave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another common misunderstanding was that the Civil War was fought over slavery. Wrong. In 4 Yankee states, (Maryland, West Virginia, Delaware, and Washington D.C.) slaves were owned. These states never seceded, but were not required to free their slaves. What hypocrisy. The only difference between Northern and Southern slaves is that Southern slaves worked in fields, while Northern ones worked in a factories. And in 1862, the U.S. Congress (made up of all Yankees since Southern congressmen went to form our own nation) refused to pass a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery. How can you require Southerners to free slaves if you won't free yours? And yet another misunderstanding is that all Southern slave owners abused slaves. In fact, there were laws protecting slaves from being abused. Ulysses S. Grant was often in court being tried for slave abuse. So why are only Southern slave owners stereotyped for abusing slaves? Knowing northerners abused slaves, why don't you also see the American flag as a symbol of racism?\n",
      "\n",
      "So, one might ask, if the war wasn't fought over slavery, what was it fought over? The war was fought because of growing tensions between the North and South. Yes, slavery was a cause of tensions, but not the main one. The main problem between the North and South was political views. Political views between the North and South differed since the early days of America. The South was an agricultural region, depending highly on cotton in its economy. The North on the other hand, was an industrial region. The North needed a central government to build a road and railway system to protect its trading and financial interests, and also to control national currency. Being highly dependent on agriculture, the South needed less a central government, and opposed the idea of a complex system of roadways and railways. As you can see, slavery was only a small issue during the Civil War.\n",

      "I think another reason people associate the Confederate flag with racism is people always associate the Ku Klux Klan with the Confederate flag. This is not true. The Klan was a group of white Christians living in the South that were afraid of foreigners taking away the rights of whites in America. It has nothing to do with the Confederacy. Here is a picture of Klan members flying American, not Confederate flags on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C. After viewing this, and reading the rest of this, why do you associate the Confederate flag with the racism?\n",
      "This is very fun and thank you for posting it. I've seen a few choices with Shanks, Whitebeard and Kuma. People seem to be thinking of your own teams strength's vs what the consequences of NOT having choose them would be as well. I thought I'd make a strength list with a simple breakdown of their strength, weakness, position and \n",
      "specific usefulness in a team.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Whitebeard - Offensive - Strongest Man in the World, Quake fruit and haki - Whitebeard is with his fruit, haki and weapon is just a beast. The war of the best showed just how strong Whitebeard was and where he ranked against everyone else. People like to give Akainu credit with beating whitebeard but his stab injury or his illness worsened by the stab caused him to be open to Akainu's attack. An uninjured WB would be smacking most the \"brats\" left and right. There's also the chance that his illness could momentarily cripple him leaving him or open. Not choosing WB could go one of two ways: Bad and very bad. WB could sit back while everyone else attacks only to join the fight at the end or in the very bad scenario he could start rampaging from the start.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Shanks Offensive - Haki, Haki and more Haki - Between Shanks and WB it was tough deciding who was stronger. One is sick and old and the other has one arm. I believe that both character have a lot of power but that their prime fighting days are behind them. Shank's Haki would allow him to deal with the lower DF users or make them hesitate when engaging him. The biggest downside to shanks is that he has one arm. While he could fight anyone on the list 1v1 I dont see him dealing with multiple people with what weve seen of him. Not choosing shanks is pretty much guaranteeing one of your teammates to be held up or in deep trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Dragon - Defensive - Wind Logia with Haki - I'm going with the assumption that Dragon has a Wind Logia. The revloutionary army can almost be compared to Yonkou's empire. If we look at how strong Sabo, the second in command, is and look at the distance in strength from marco to WB, Burgess to BB then Dragon is probably around Yokou level. I put defensively because his wind could be used to hide, separate and push enemies back. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. Akainu - Offensive- Magma Paramecia with Haki - Akainu is number 4 because if the Fleet Admiral or any of the Admiral were as powerful or more than the Yokou than they'd probably have taken them out. Akainu's offensive ability is probably one of highest because each time he's used it (Ace and WB) the damage was Fatal. Luffy and Jimbei would have died as well if Law wasn't nearby and in this scenario Law isn't here. Having survived several haki attacks from various haki users (WB especially) he's proven durable. From his fight with Kuzan we know he can fight for a long time. His magma attacks from the sky could be used to hold down the attackers/pursuers.  Not choosing him would likely force one of teammates to focus on dealing with him unless you want magma raining down on your or his magma punches coming at you unexpected.\n",

      "5. Hawkeye - Offenive - Swordsman with Haki - Hawkeye is probably one of the strongest warlords in the series. He can create a giant sword slash which could be used against the logias on the list. Other than dodging his attacks could anyone besides Shanks, WB, DF or Kuma deflect/parry his attack? I've thought that Diamond Jozu's DF might give the ability to take any attacks or make his body indestructible. Could the other logias or non'weapon users deal with his haki sword attacks? Since not much is known other than where he might stand power wise his abilities are hard to judge. \n",
      "\n",
      "6. Donflamingo Donquixote - Offensive and Defensive - Awakened Paramecia with 3 types of Haki. Donflamingo is very versatile compared to many of the others. He can attack from anywhere, he large offensive and defensive abilities, control people , create clones and attack from a distance. He's very durable and can attack with haki if his DF isn't available to use. Not choosing Donflamingo could lead to one of your teammates or yourself being caught by his parasite string. \n",
      "\n",
      "7. Admiral Zypher - Offensive - Haki User - There's not as much to say about Zypher except that he lost to luffy (before or after fishman?) and luffy didn't use many of the attacks or gear we've seen since Ch. 798. Against DF users he'd do very well but I dont think he'd be able to hold off more than 1 or 2 of the lower ranked ones. I think not choosing him would be a mild threat since he's strong but not that strong. He's got haki and the seastone arm which could negate some of the DF users.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Blackbeard (pre-Guru-Guru no mi) - Defensive or offensive - I'm choosing to go with this version of him because whitebeard is alive in this scenario. While Blackbeard's body is tough and his fruit is almost OP this version of him nearly lost to a dying whitebeard (also having been a member of WBs crew BB new how WB fight and how his fruit could counter it). He can hold his own against the next few higher ranked figthers but he has a history of going down from attacks (WB and Ace's attack left him rolling on the ground) which would leave him open for defeat against the top ranked guys or leave you open to attack. Because of his fruit and durability Not Choosing BB would leave most logia teammates you choose to be separated, stalled or made ineffective.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Bartholomew Kuma - Defensive/Support - The list is based strength 1v1 so thats why he's this low. His abilities and speed make him great for defending attacks and protecting. I'm not sure if his paw paw fruit allows him to send opponents away who are stronger than him but since there's been no limitation mentioned I'm going off that. His bomb/blast ability would be great for spreading everyone out if your team gets overwhelmed. Not choosing Kuma could have very serious drawbacks. His ability could knock away your teams attacks or even separate members of your team leaving you open.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Enel Offensive or Defensive - Logia with Observation Haki. Lighting is similar to Magma in that if you get hit with it the damage will be very severe to fatal. His Mantra will allow him to dodge and attack/intercept those who are currently most threatening. His lack of Armament Haki and overconfidence put him lower on the list compared to the others. Not choosing Enel is a big gamble in either direction. His overconfidence could cause him rush into immediate conflict where he' likely meet a much stronger fighter or a haki user. In a worse case scenario he could sit back, thinking all the peasants fights are beneath him, and use his mantra to find a vulnerable moment to zap you.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Ace - Offensive - Logia with no haki. Even though Ace is a logia, a commander on WB's ship and a experienced fighter he would lose   to most (he already lost to 3 on list) in JUST a 1v1. Not picking Ace isn't  a big loss compared to the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. Crocodile - Defensive - Logia with no haki. He could change the environment and be used as wall to intercept attacks with his Logia element. There are many heavy hitters with haki in the list that would make his defense crumble very fast. He could prove lethal if he gets by your chosen two but I don't see him getting that far.\n",
      "I originally couldn't play due to time requirements, but was asked to come in after a few sessions of the original group. I never played a rogue before, so I decided to play a Swashbuckler-Archetype Rogue that's going to specialize in disarming opponents in battle. We are at level 5 right now.\n",

      "Those of us on foot continue until we reach a small plateau and scramble up. Trackers on horses try climbing up after us and make it halfway up before we all simultaneously jump down and steal the horses, claiming they can come back with us or go back to the prison without either horses or prisoners.
